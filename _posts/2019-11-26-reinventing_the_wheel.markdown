It has been a long process but I have reached the final project.  Unfortunately, I was having issues deciding on what I should build.  I am on a bit of a time crunch so I had to abandon, for now, my original project idea of building a full e-commerce site.  

So I looked back at my first project for inspiration.  My CLI project scraped IMDB and showed displayed information about the top box office movies.  It no longer works due to IMDB constantly updating there source HTML to discourage scraping.  I had anticipated this happening.  But this opened up the opportunity to allow me to build a new movie/tv application for my final project since I will not be including the CLI in my portfolio.  

This time I wanted to use an API and utilize my newly learned development skills.  Luckily I was able to find an API called The Movie Database API.  It includes a lot of the same types of information that sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB provide and is free.  The project will start out basic but there will be room for continual updates.  And it will address an issue that I've been running into lately.  I keep forgetting tv shows and movies that I want to watch, either from ads I see or from friend's recommendations.  Now I'll be able to keep my own tracking list!  With my project decision made, now comes the fun part.

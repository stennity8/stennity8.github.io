I am what you might call a researcher and often times with big decisions I tend to overthink them.  When I decided to start learning to program in the summer of 2018 I spent a lot of time looking at blog posts and chat forums trying to decide what would be the best course of action and what language to learn. 

During the beginning of my research the sentiment seemed to be to just start coding.  This is easier said then done.  So I continued to "research" for another week.  Over that next week I continued to see two distinct opinions.  Opinion #1 was usually something like "you should learn #{insert_language_here} if you want to find a job, any other language is not worth it."  Opinion #2 was "the first language doesn't matter.  Just pick one and start learning to program.  Once you learn one language the next one gets easier, and the next even easier, and so on."  So I chose to start learning JavaScript as there seemed to be a lot of resources available.

Over the next few months I began learning JavaScript and really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, I didn't feel like I was progressing on my own and a friend who is a developer recommended I check out Coding Bootcamps since his company had some good luck hiring several bootcamp graduates.  I am going to cover my full journey, including that decision process, in another blog post but I ultimately decided that Flatiron School was the best fit for me.

I would be lying if I wasn't concerned about having to learn Ruby after spending a bunch of time just learning JS.  But I watched a video of Avi Flombaum talking about Flatiron School.  In that video he echoed Opinion #2 from my initial research into programming.  He also emphasized that Flatiron School would teach me to be a Software Engineer and not just someone who can program in  #{insert_language_here}.  So I took the leap and I am now almost through the first section of the self-paced program.

I can honestly tell you that Opinion #2 is in fact correct.  I was able learn Ruby, at least the basics, much quicker than I was able to learn JavaScript.  So if you have any doubt like I did, embrace the process and enjoy the journey.  In no time we can all reach our goal of becoming Software Engineers.

Well it took me a little over four weeks but I made it to the first milestone of the Flatiron School Online Software Engineering Program.  I felt prepared to face the challenge as I had started attending Study Groups and watching recorded Study Groups all about the CLI Project and Ruby in general after my first week.

The truly hard part was deciding on what project to choose.  I had so many ideas running through my head and I feel like I changed my mind several times a day leading up to my pre-project meeting.  I finally narrowed it down to at least involve movies or TV in some way, as like many people I enjoy both.

So I began scouring the internet for something different to me that would keep my interest.  I was on IMDB and noticed that there was a section that listed all the "Top Box Office" movies and their earnings.  I like to read reviews of shows/movies and look at ratings on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, etc.  Generally that is how I get an idea of what the public thinks of them.  But I thought having access to a movie's box office performance would be an additional metric that's nice to have quick access to.

With my project picked I began the preliminary planning stage.  To me this was the most important take away from this first project.  Well that and how cool the #send is.  But for this blog I'm going to focus on the planning.  There is however a great video on #send from Jennifer Hansen that is definitely worth checking out: https://instruction.learn.co/student/video_lectures#/394(http://)  

While preparing for my project I noticed that in almost every study group or walk through video the lecturer always took the time to write out a pseudo code step by step of what the general functionality and flow of the CLI would be.  It seemed like such a simple thing but throughout the lecturer's development of the CLI they continued to reference it and use it as a guide to help move the project along.  It enabled them to break the project down into small manageable chunks.  I had heard that it was important to break projects down like this but seeing it in action really drove that home for me.

So once I got the setup out of the way(which was a difficult process to tackle itself), I spent a solid hour just writing out how I wanted my program to function and the flow.  I knew this was not set in stone and that it was going to be more of a general guideline but I really tried to make it as specific as possible.  

Once I finished my outline of how I wanted my project to flow and function I jumped into getting the code written.  I would be lying if I said that writing the code was magically easy just by creating the outline, but it helped immensely.  I was able to stay on task and pick away at my project one small chunk at a time.

So if you are just starting the CLI Project, or any project for that matter, take a little extra time and put your plan/outline down on paper or in markdown file.  I think you'll be surprised how good a use of your time it will have been.

This post is all about me and why I chose to join Flatiron School.

Those who know me will tell you talking about myself is not exactly my favorite thing to do.  But maybe someone else reads my story and can relate.  Making a career change is not an easy thing to do, and this would qualify as my third.  

I first went to college for business and received a bachelor's degree with a concentration in finance.  This led me to a position working as a Mutual Fund Accounting Analyst.  The highlight of this job was working with Excel.  When I first started this job I had no idea what a macro was but a lot the spreadsheets we used daily had them.  I found it fascinating that you could click a button and all this work would magically get done.  I also noticed that the team member who was most familiar with writing the code for the macros appeared to be an indispensable member of the team.  So I made it a goal to learn to write them once I got up to speed on the day to day of the job.  Long story short about a year later that team member had left and I had filled his shoes as the go to guy for macros and excel based applications.  

Unfortunately, that was one of the few aspects of that job I enjoyed and during this time the market crashed.  I was ready for a change.  I was taking a hard look at what I wanted out a career and decided to go back to school.  I knew I wanted to solve problems daily and noticed I was watching engineering programs on the science channel regularly.  So I decided to start working towards a degree in engineering.  I'm still not sure why I didn't choose Software Engineering or Computer Science right away.  I guess I always knew that it was an option after getting an engineering degree in a different discipline.  Or secretly hoped that I would end up in a job that required some programming.

So I went back to school and settled on Civil Engineering.  It was an up and down journey since I was basically starting over coming from a business degree.  But I can honestly say that I love to learn and embraced the challenge.  I eventually graduated and began working in the field as Project Engineer.  

About a year into that job it was becoming pretty clear that Civil Engineering was not going to provide me what I was looking for in a long term career.  SInce I had invested so much time and effort into this change I wasn't ready to just move on to the next thing.  I spent a lot of time contemplating if it was just the company I was working for or the specific work I was doing, but ultimately I decided to start looking outside the field.  

I began researching Software Engineering and started doing some self teaching.  I figured that if I had lost my interest in it then I'd know pretty quickly.  Well as you can probably guess, I loved it.  I began researching graduate programs with the intention to enroll and start working towards a master's degree in computer science as a way to break into the industry.  During this time though, I had a discussion with a friend who is a Software Developer and he mentioned bootcamps.  He told me that his company had hired several people from them and had good luck.  He suggested I check them out as a way to quickly transition into the industry.  

I started researching bootcamps for several months and eventually settled on Flatiron School.  I quit my job in May to focus on this full time.  It was scary quitting my job but I can say it has definitely been worth it so far.  I can't give everyone the "it all worked out in the end" yet, but hopefully in a few months I can write that "I got my first software job" post.

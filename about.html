<p>My name is Shawn Tennity.  After self-learning to program for 8 months I decided to leave my job as a Civil Engineer and focus full-time on becoming a Software Engineer.  I am currently attending Flatiron School's Online Software Engineering Program to help facilitate and focus this process.</p>
